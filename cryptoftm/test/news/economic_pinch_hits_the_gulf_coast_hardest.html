            <p>Nearly half of households in Mississippi, Alabama, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Texas are finding it at least somewhat difficult to cover their expenses, according to Census data. <br> <br>

                The data is in, and it’s not encouraging: More Americans are feeling financially strapped.

Other marginalized groups, including the trans population (55.5%), also feel these effects particularly strongly.
