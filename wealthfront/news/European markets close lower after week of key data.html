               <p>
                European markets closed slightly lower on Friday, as investors continue to assess the impact of inflation and production data from the U.S. and U.K., alongside company earnings.
                <br> <br>
                The pan-European Stoxx 600
                 index provisionally ended the session down 0.2%, trimming losses from earlier in the day. Oil and gas stocks led losses with a 1.9% drop, followed by tech, which was down 1.6%.
                 <br> <br>
                
                Banks slipped 0.6%. The worst-performing stock in this category was NatWest
                , down 6.7%, after the British bank issued a note of caution on future profits.
               </p>

               <p>
                Sectors including telecoms and utilities traded higher.
                <br> <br>

The Stoxx 600 has had a strong week, during which both the U.K.’s FTSE 100 and France’s CAC 40 hit record intraday highs, even as U.S. stocks fell. U.S. markets were again lower in Friday morning trade.

U.S. wholesale prices rose 0.7% in January, exceeding expectations and fueling fears over the country’s stubbornly high inflation metrics.
