            <p class="subheading">The largest private equity firms in the world manage billions of dollars of capital.</p>

            <p>
                After a booming year of deals in 2021, the  market has slowed significantly so far in 2022. The end of the current business cycle will likely bring an end to record-setting private equity performance. Investors have become increasingly uncertain about the outlook for i interest rates, economic growth and asset valuations. Data from the first half of 2022 revealed a sharp decline in private equity exits and deal volumes. Still, global private equity firms generated $512 billion in buyout deal value during the first half of 2022, with an average deal size of about $1 billion. Here's a look at how private equity works and the top players in the private equity world.

            <p class="subheading"><br>How private equity works</p>

            <p>
                Private equity firms raise capital from pensions, endowments, sovereign wealth funds and other institutions and use this capital to invest in private companies. These private companies do not trade on the public stock market, making them inaccessible to the typical retail investor. Private equity firms often implement structural or strategic changes to underperforming businesses to help streamline their performance and potentially increase their valuation. Once a company's business metrics improve, the PE firm can then sell the business to public investors for a profit via an initial public offering. PE firms refer to these sales as exits. Private Equity International recently released its annual PEI 300 list of the top private equity firms in the world based on money raised over the past five years. Here are the 10 private equity firms that topped this year's PEI 300 list.
